# STM32-base F1 template

This repository contains a template for starting projects based on the STM32F1 series devices using the [STM32-base repository](https://github.com/ThomasGravekamp/STM32-base). The code found in this repository has been tested with a STM32F103x8 device mounted on a board also known as a "Blue pill".

## Usage

To use this template, clone the [STM32-base repository](https://github.com/ThomasGravekamp/STM32-base) either directly in this templates folder or create a symbolic link to it.
